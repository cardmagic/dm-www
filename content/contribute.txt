DataMapper is always looking for more contributers.  When you've got an itch to scratch, jump in and contribute!  Write a few specs showing us how your code works, create a patch and "submit it":http://wm.lighthouseapp.com/projects/4819-datamapper/overview as a new ticket or a fix for an existing one.  After a few patches and many thanks, you'll get commit access.  

We benchmark all but the most trivial of patches, because we care about performance and you should too!

h2. What we need

Currently DataMapper needs help in a few particular areas:

* API Documentation (using the "Merb documentation style":http://yehudakatz.com/2008/01/14/merbnext/)
* Tutorials
* Code contributions
* Bug Reports

h2. Git - Edge DataMapper

DataMapper development has switched to the "Git":http://git.or.cz SCM. Please see "using git":using-git.html to learn how to contribute.

<div class="CodeRay">
  <pre>$ git clone git://github.com/sam/dm-core.git</pre>
</div>

h2. SVN - Bug Fixes for 0.2.5 (gem before The Great Refactor)

SVN development is for 0.2.5 (Stable) bug-fixes only. Edge DataMapper has moved to "Git":http://github.com/sam/dm-core

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
$ svn co http://datamapper.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/ data_mapper
<% end %>

h2. Code Style Guidelines

When contributing any code to DataMapper, please follow these guidelines.

# Spec first. Spec thoroughly. (DataMapper is written with "Rspec":http://rspec.info/)
# Parentheses around parameter lists for methods
# Two space indent - not tabs!
# Documentation is required (use the "Merb documentation style":http://yehudakatz.com/2008/01/14/merbnext/)
